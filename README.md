# Companies Directory

A fully responsive, interactive companies directory built with React and Material UI. This project features real data filtering, searching, sorting, pagination, and a modern design layout optimized for usability and engagement.

***

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the complete workflow of professional web app development, from data modeling to user experience design. As a computer science graduate, I created this directory as a showcase of front-end engineering, UI/UX principles, and practical modern React skills. The app helps users explore, search, and filter through a database of top companies using a clean, intuitive interface.

## Features

- **Live Search**: Instantly filter companies by name as you type.
- **Dynamic Filtering**: Narrow down results by location and industry using dropdowns.
- **Sorting**: Sort data by company name, location, or industry.
- **Pagination**: Browse results with easy navigation.
- **Professional Layout**: Centralized, responsive card design with a clear project subtitle.
- **Accessible and Consistent**: Keyboard navigable and mobile-responsive.
- **Custom Theming**: Uses engaging color schemes and subtle animations for an inviting experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React** (with hooks)
- **Material UI (MUI)** for layout, theming, and components
- **JavaScript (ES6+)**
- **Local JSON data file** (or JSON Server API, easily swappable)
- **Git & GitHub** for version control
